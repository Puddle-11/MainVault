# TMA 44 - Tight Rope
Tight rope, is a recording from the previous archivist, that covers a story from a young child in Russia, visiting a circus with his little brother and father.

### Points of Interest
 1. the lady at the entrance of the circus speaks in a weird way and is not bothered by the cold despite being dressed in a leotard.
 2. There is a lion in a cage behind one of the tents, this lion moves in a doll like way, like its being pulled, as well as when it roars, its mouth does not move. The circus workers describe it as "not being finished"
 3. The freak show. The freak show is first of all something that shouldn't exist, as the Russian circus doesn't have a freak show, and it was also abolished in all American circus's before this time. Inside the freak show, there are people that are biologically impossible, elongated limbs, body parts in places they shouldn't be, notably a mouth not on a face, or a body without a head. arms that are to long, or elongated heads.
 4. The bag in the cage. Our protagonist finds a burlap bag tied tightly around with rope, When a steam organ plays to signify the beginning of the show, the bag moves and contorts. 
 5. The tight rope. This is the final scene in the circus. In this scene we see a crowd of towns people cheering and jeering at a scene below. Two clowns brutally fighting to the death. A large clown, beating a small one to death, breaking his bones, and his poke-dot shirt stained in blood. The protagonists father is in the crowd, and notes that the laughter from the crowd seems wrong. There is a tight rope stretched across the tent, with Ivan. The protagonists brother, walking along it. It is important to note that the protagonist has a life long fear of falling.
 6. Memory loss. Ivan has no memory of the event, he remembers running through the gates but nothing after. Although Ivan still has nightmares of being tied up in rough rope, around the same time of year the circus game.
