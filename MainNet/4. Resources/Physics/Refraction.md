# Refraction
Refraction is the effect of light changing its angle as it passes through a medium. While individual photons don't "change speed" functionally at a macro scale, light moves slower through different mediums.

The reason light changes direction when moving through a medium is simple. Light acts as a wave, a wave has a diameter, as one side of the wave enters the medium first it will slow down, while the other side stays the same speed, this causes it to refract. this is also the reason that often different wavelengths will refract at different angles, making a rainbow.
Calculate the angle of refraction using [[Snellâ€“Descarte's law Law]]
