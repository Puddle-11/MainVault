# Overlapping Space
overlapping spaces is a concept in [[Non-Euclidian Spaces]] where two spaces can occupy the same space. A common example of this is a house divided into 4ths with more than 4 rooms, where multiple rooms occupy the same space. As you walk around the center of the house, in most cases a poll or a wall, you will enter rooms that were previously inaccessible.
