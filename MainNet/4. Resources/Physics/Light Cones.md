## Light Cones
Light cones are apart of the [[General Theory of Relativity]], every object has a [[Light Cones]], these light cones represent your entire universe, your area of influence. everything that you can touch, is inside these light cones, the light cones radius expands outwards at the speed of light from any one moment. Since no physical matter can move faster than the speed of light, you will never be able to leave your light cone. or interact with anything outside of it. [[Light Cones]] are also used in the parallel universe theory with [[Black Holes]]
