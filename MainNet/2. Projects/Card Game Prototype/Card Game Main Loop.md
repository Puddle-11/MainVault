## Card Game Main Loop
The main loop of the game is as follows.
- Pre-hand: each player starts with 5 hearts and a deck of standard 52 cards, the first to lose all 5 hearts loses the game.

1. Each player is given one [[Ticket]] at the start of their turn. this ticket is unknown to the player and has a special effect, the ticket given is determined by a random pull given each tickets [[Ticket Rarity]].
2. Each player can now draw up to 7 cards for the hand.
3. Each player at this point each player can choose to play their [[Ticket]] until they play their 3 cards for the hand, or save their [[Ticket]] for the next round, [[Ticket]]'s roll over and are cumulative so its possible to a accrue up to 7 total [[Ticket]]'s at once which can be used on one hand. They can also use their discards in an attempt to get better cards, each player is given 3 discards at the start of the game, however may earn more through tickets.
4. Once each player does their pre-play actions ([[Ticket]], [[Discards]]), they are free to choose their 3 cards they want to put up. These cards are sorted in descending order and will face off against the other players card.![[Card Game Prototype Cards Both Players Played.png]]
5. Each card is then scored based on the [[Card Game Prototype Scoring]] metric, the user with the least points when the scoring is complete, loses a heart or hearts if [[Increased Damage]] ticket has been played
