# Card Game Ticket System
The ticket system in this game is quite simple. There are standard playing cards, the standard 52 deck, but there's also [[Ticket]]'s. tickets give special boosts, check the list below for some effects. Once per turn a ticket is added to each players ticket deck, which maxes out at 8. if the player chooses not to draw that turn, the ticket will stay in their ticket deck.
Players can only draw a ticket before they play their standard 3 cards.
