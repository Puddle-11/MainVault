# Metroidvania Prototype

Genre: Metroid Vania + Bullet Hell
	Hook: Aerial based combat
	Setting: Steampunk setting
	Style: TBA
	World Building: The main character is a mechanical angel that lived among the heavens and has fallen to the world below. One of their wings is gone, and they can no longer fly as they used to be able to. In order to create a prosthetic wing, they scour the world for parts to build a new wing for themself. The world below is full of deadly ancient machines and robots that were used in warfare for many centuries resulting in nearly all life being depleted. The only remaining life are half-robotic people that live in small, secluded villages, hidden away from the ancient killing weapons.
