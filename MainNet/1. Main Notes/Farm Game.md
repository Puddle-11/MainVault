# Farm Game

Genre: Survival, Mystery, City Builder

Main Concept:
	Build a Norse town on a secluded northern island, discover the truth behind the island and its old magic

Player Hook:
	tbd

Game Vision:
	The vision of the game is to make something line [[Frostpunk]] with the aesthetics of [[Easy Delivery Co.]], or throne-fall.

Unique Selling Point:
	The art style and mystery is a selling point, as well as the personal nature of the game. Your ability to see where the family line goes and see the death/birth of new family members makes it closer to the sims than a game like [[Frostpunk]], but it maintains the large scale [[Frostpunk]] mechanics.
Target Audience:
	Simulation players, city builders, and mystery game players
