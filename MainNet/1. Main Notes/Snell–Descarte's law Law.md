# Snellâ€“Descarte's law

Snell-Descartes law was founded by [[Willebrord Snellius]] and [Descartes](obsidian://open?vault=MainVault&file=MainNet%2F1.%20Main%20Notes%2FDescartes)

The law states that, for a given pair of media, the ratio of the sines of [[Angle of Incidence]] $\theta_1$ and the angle of refraction $\theta_2$ is equal to the refractive index of the second medium with regard to the first $n_{21}$ which is equal to the ratio of the [[Refractive Indices]] ${\Large \frac{n_2}{n_1}}$ of the two media, or equivalently, to the ratio of the [[Phase Velocities]] ${\Large \frac{v_1}{v_2}}$ in the two media
$$
{\LARGE \frac{sin \theta_1}{sin \theta_2} = n_{2,1} = \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{v_1}{v_2}}
$$

The law follows from [[Fermat]]'s [[Principle of Least Time]] which in turn follows from the propagation of light as waves.
