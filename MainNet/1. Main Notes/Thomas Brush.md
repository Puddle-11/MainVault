# Thomas Brush
### Intro
Thomas brush is a solo indie developer that developed [[Pinstripe]] and [[Neversong]], Both of these games were successes, and he is currently developing his next game [[Twisted Towers]] in a team he hired, he is the founder of [[Atmos Games]] and has been developing games since his days in high School, starting with simple flash games like [[Coma]] and [[Skinny]],
### Skills
Thomas is primarily an artist and Game Designer, rather than "Game Developer", This means while he has great insight into artistic direction and over arching game design, he has few technical skills with programming. This led to him hiring a full time developer for his team, rather than continuing to develop solo like [[Neversong]] and [[Pinstripe]].

He is also regarded as a business man, with his course Full Time Game Dev, being his largest source of income for a brief period. For this reason I find taking advice from him on technical aspects of game development to be foolish, and his content much more attuned to new and amateur game developers. With experienced developers deriving little from his content.
