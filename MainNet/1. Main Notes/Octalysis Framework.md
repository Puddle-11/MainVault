# Octalysis Framework
The Octalysis Framework outlines 8 different facets for fun/gamification.

## Gamification/Human focused design

### Epic Meaning
Epic meaning is the drive for players or users to do something "greater" than themselves. The idea that the things you are doing are greater than what others are capable of or that you are achieving something meaningful in game. This comes into play when we look at the hero's journey, where people want to put themselves in the shoes of a hero who saves the world or something along those lines.
### Accomplishment
Accomplishment is the drive in ever person to achieve something challenging. Because of this, its very easy to develop to cater to this drive. Making a hard challenge with a reward at the end, even if the reward is just a trophy is enough to make people attempt the challenge 
### Empowerment of Creativity
Empowerment of creativity is the type of flow that comes from creative expression in solving a puzzle or advancing in a game. An example of a game that does this well is [[Tears of the Kingdom]], TOTK allows the player nearly unlimited creativity. Because of this, all the problems in TOTK can be solved in multiple ways. This keeps the player empowered and keeps them finding new creative solutions.
### Ownership
Ownership is a large motivator even in the real world. the desire to own something or accumulate wealth is strong in most people. The brain can be tricked pretty easily though and owning virtual goods feels the same as owning real ones. Giving the player a perceived sense of ownership not only gives them a sense of accomplishment but also a tie to your digital world. Keeping them coming back to the world since they own things in that world. 
### Social Influence
The social influence incorporates all social drives. These social drives are very complex and have been developed throughout human history as we developed society. An example of a social drive for games is a leaderboard, this also ties into a sense of Accomplishment, but for a leader board, it is a display of social status. 

### Scarcity
Scarcity and Impatience ties into the [[The Zeigarnik Effect]]. The idea that something you can't have or haven't "finished" will stick in your head for a while. Keeping things scarce while encouraging the players to go after them will create a feeling of incompleteness whenever you leave the game, prompting you to return after a while.
### Unpredictability
Unpredictability or Curiosity is the drive to find out what happens next. Most people finish or read novels, movies, or tv shows because of this drive. There is nothing inherently fun about sitting on a couch and watching a story unfold but the desire to know what happens next keeps us there. Another main drive for this is sympathy, the more you can sympathize with the characters the more emotion you will feel as the story unfolds.

### Avoidance
Avoidance is the drive to minimize loss. For games, the drive would be to continue moving forward so your previous progress was not in vain. This drive is the driving force in survival games as well, dying will cause you to lose hours of progress and resources so your desire to stay alive is stronger than ever. 

## Making a game fun
To make a game fun its generally agreed you need a couple things.

- An epic, A sense of grandeur, something the player would not be able to do in the real world. a fantasy of some sort that they get to fulfil in the game world.
- A sense of progress, Awards, Achievements, or some sense of time passing and progress being made, this is required for both avoidance and Accomplishment. 
- Creative freedom, for the player to explore ways to change the story or new ways to solve problems.
- Player choice, a game without player choice is just a movie.
