# Analog Horror

Analog horror is one of the most common forms of liminality. Analog horror takes nostalgia and twists it. Its well known there is a sort of nostalgia that this generation has with early analog tech and footage. grainy footage or old photos from the 70s or even earlier. While nostalgia is a mix of comfort and longing, it also has a sense of familiarity. This sense of familiarity is what allows analog horror to be so terrifying. 

### Distortion
Often in Analog Horror, they will distort the media in some way to make it unfamiliar. A common way to do this, which is seen in [[The Mandela Catalogue]], [[Local 58]], and [[Gemini Home Entertainment]] Is making the media exist in an alternate universe. With [[The Mandela Catalogue]] the media exists in a world overrun by "duplicates" of man, doppelgangers, Which allows for some interesting sequences, Taking standard PSA announcements, like nation wide nuclear alerts or safety alerts, and morphing them into Doppelganger alerts. Warning the people of this universe against the horror that is invading the world. 

In [[Local 58]] They take standard news and television, and alter it to be still familiar but well outside the range of what is considered "normal". For instance, a cartoon that depicts a man in an open grave decaying as a moon with a face looks down upon him. 

These subversions take things we know, and transforms them into things deeply unsettling. This type of work, in my opinion works well because a lot of horror works on subverting what has been established, However in standard horror the establishing has to be done in the length of the work. With this, we have pre-established connections not just to the genre but to the form of media itself, making the subversion much more effective.
### Advantages of media
Unlike the modern media of today, analog footage or media has a sort of corruption or obfuscation. We all know the scariest things are the ones we *Don't* see. With this type of media we can obfuscate the monsters in the dark, allowing for more terror, seeing maybe a hand or part of a face but never the full thing.
