# Weird-Core
[[Weird-Core]] is a variation of [[Dream-Core]], Taking [[Dream-Core]] and making it darker. Much more nightmarish as seen in some of the examples. Where [[Dream-Core]] doesn't really have an objective feeling its trying to make you feel, [[Weird-Core]] very much wants you to feel unnerved. A common theme in [[Weird-Core]] is eyes, and emphasis on eyes in unnatural places. It is well known that disembodied eyes can invoke a sensation of being watched, Adding posters with eyes in places of high crime can greatly reduce crime rate.

[[Weird-Core]] takes what [[Dream-Core]] does and amplifies it. the slightly unnerving aesthetic of [[Dream-Core]] is now full blown in your face. It is obvious these spaces are not only impossible but borderline hostile to life.
