# The Zeigarnik Effect
The Zeigarnik effect is the psychological phenomenon where people stop an activity before completing it, will have much stronger recollection of that activity than someone who completed it before stopping.
This effect shows that people generally have a stronger recollection of what they haven't achieved than what they have. Unfinished tasks will take up the brains cognitive processing until it is either completed or forgotten completely.
The Zeigarnik effect can be used in game development to make sure a player remembers your game and returns to it after some time.
