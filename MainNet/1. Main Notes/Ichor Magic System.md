# Ichor Magic System
The Ichor magic system and its origins

### Origins
All magic comes from a source of power, this one happens to be the corpse of a god. Similar to Owl House, the source of the magic is the power radiating from a dead god, although in this case its *THE* god and not just a titan.
his blood specifically is used to cast spells and make magic sigils.
