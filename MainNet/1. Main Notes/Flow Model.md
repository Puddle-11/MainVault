# Flow Model
The flow model, developed by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, describes how to keep users engaged in a product. 
The general idea of flow is to stay in a challenging but not to challenging state, ramping up difficulty and engagement as the skill increases. This model is extremely important in Game Design when trying to keep players playing your game for longer. 

### The Conditions for Flow
1. Clear Goals
2. Balance between perceived challenges and perceived goals.
3. Clear and immediate feedback
