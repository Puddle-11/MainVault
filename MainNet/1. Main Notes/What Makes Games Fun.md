# What Makes Games Fun
There are some theories of fun but making games "fun" or specifically having good game ideas is more than just making them fun, there are a lot of theories of fun, like the flow model, that don't encompass the entirety of "good game ideas", games like [[Before Your Eyes]] has a very simple flat skill curve, by all intents and purposes it should be very boring but it is a story driven game, with over 15k reviews on steam. With that being said let's explore some themes i have seen with games and how well they preform. 

The biggest thing that I found when looking at high ranking games is consistent art styles. Art style is something super finicky because games like, [[Wandersong]] have a very simplistic art style, But because they lean into their limitations, it works. its mostly flat colors with super simple rigging. There are many flash games in which the artist was trying to make something above their skill level, NOT leaning into their weaknesses, and instead trying to cover them up, overdetailing, shading incorrectly. Things they don't know how to do but are trying anyways, this always ruins an art style. Games like [[Wandersong]] and [[Smile for Me]] really show us that we don't need to be super skilled artists to make something beautiful, we just need an eye for design. 

One of the other things i found when looking at high selling or successful games is their story and mechanics. Some games have a real emphasis on the flow of their game, how fun it is, while others are super concerned with the story. If a game has both, a very good story and fun mechanics, it will be an amazing 10/10 game. Games like hollow knight with fun repetitive mechanics, and a deep story with a lot of lore and backstory, are rated as some of the best games in the world. But there are games that have one or the other, that still sell well, games like [[Before Your Eyes]], [[Milk Inside a Bag of Milk Inside a Bag of Milk]], and [[Milk Outside a Bag of Milk Outside a Bag of Milk]] are entirely story focused, with virtually no real gameplay, a glorified visual novel. However they still sell quite well, since their stories are so fleshed out. With that being said, when coming up with a game idea, its best to have a good core gameplay loop with a solid story to go along with it.
