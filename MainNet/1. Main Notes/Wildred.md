# Wildred

The feeling of haunting solitude of extremely remote places, a clearing in the forest, a windswept field of snow, a rest area in the middle of nowhere - Which makes you feel like you've just intruded on a conversation that had nothing to do with you, where even the gravel beneath your feet and the trees overhead are holding themselves back to a pointed, inhospitable silence.
