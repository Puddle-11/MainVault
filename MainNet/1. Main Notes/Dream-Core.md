# Dream Core
[[Dream-Core]] is not so much about invoking a feeling like [[Analog Horror]] or [[Analog Comfort]], This is much more an aesthetic. 

[[Dream-Core]] is defined by bright color palettes and impossible scenes. This design is supposed to give the feeling of dreaminess that cant quite be found in media based in reality. 

[[Dream-Core]] takes nostalgia, amplifies and perverts it. Its specifically designed to induce a sense of confusion or unsettledness.
