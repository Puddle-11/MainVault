# Empty Space Liminality
[[Empty Space Liminality]] is the foundation of [[Liminality]], [[Empty Space Liminality]] deals specifically with places that should be full, but aren't. Spaces where you weren't meant to be alone. Train stations, or schools after hours. These places aren't dangerous, But they aren't comforting like the images of [[Analog Comfort]] 

The places are not just empty though. It is the feeling of disconnect that makes them liminal. A transition period that feels like it could never end. That no-one will ever play on the playground again. This plays on the feeling of nostalgia, since we know we can not go back, nostalgia feels always incomplete, a longing for something that is long past. and liminality is not just showing what was, but what it is now, and why we can never return.

### How to make a liminal space
### **Lack**
Remove familiar elements, anything that can give a space a unique identity. The more generic the better.
#### **Repetition**
Repeating patterns. make the image repeat in some way whether that's artificially expanding a hallway, adding extra support beams to a train station, or a repeated painting hung on a wall over and over again.
#### **Placement**
The placement of items in the image should be askew, You can see this in the composition of a lot of these examples, The photo being taken at an angle or with motion blur due to the photographer moving quickly, Like they weren't supposed to take the photo. Around a corner like they are hiding or out of sight. 
#### **Controlled Distortion**
Moving the items in the image to places they shouldn't be, chairs that cant be sit in because of their placement, or things that are functionally impossible to use because of their location. 
#### **Social Presence**
There should be no sign of life in the photo
