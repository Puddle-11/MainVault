# Coma
Coma is a short game by [[Thomas Brush]] about a boy who fell into a coma, and is now trying to wake up. This game was made during the era of flash games.
It is short, it takes about 10-15 minutes to complete, But the music and art are quite good for a flash game.

The story starts with you waking up in a room and heading outside through a distorted house. Meeting a man and a girl along your travels, going through the backward wood, returning to the house, entering the basement and ringing a door bell. Upon ringing this doorbell you wake up.

This game was one of the first games Thomas brush made and is the predecessor to [[Neversong]].
