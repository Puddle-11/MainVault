2. Each player can now draw up to 7 cards for the hand.
3. Each player tt this point each player can choose to play their ticket until they play their 3 cards for the hand, or save their ticket for the next round, tickets roll over and are cumulative so its possible to a accrue up to 7 total tickets at once which can be used on one hand.
